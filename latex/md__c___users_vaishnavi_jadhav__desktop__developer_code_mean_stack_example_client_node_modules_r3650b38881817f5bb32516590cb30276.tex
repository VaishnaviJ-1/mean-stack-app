Remove the {\ttfamily engine} option if you are using it.\hypertarget{md__c___users_vaishnavi_jadhav__desktop__developer_code_mean_stack_example_client_node_modules_r3650b38881817f5bb32516590cb30276_autotoc_md11860}{}\doxysection{Version 4}\label{md__c___users_vaishnavi_jadhav__desktop__developer_code_mean_stack_example_client_node_modules_r3650b38881817f5bb32516590cb30276_autotoc_md11860}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Better resolution of the original source location -\/ You can more successfully use {\ttfamily url()} in variables and mixins.
\item Dependencies now accept a wider range and explicit dependency on {\ttfamily rework} and {\ttfamily rework-\/visit} has been removed.
\end{DoxyItemize}

{\bfseries{Breaking Changes}}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The {\ttfamily engine} option is deprecated which means the old {\ttfamily rework} engine is deprecated.
\item The {\ttfamily keep\+Query} behaviour is now the default, the {\ttfamily keep\+Query} option has been removed.
\item The {\ttfamily remove\+CR} option defaults to {\ttfamily true} when executing on Windows OS.
\item The {\ttfamily absolute} option has been removed.
\item The {\ttfamily join} option has changed.
\end{DoxyItemize}

{\bfseries{Migrating}}

Remove the {\ttfamily engine} option if you are using it -\/ the default \char`\"{}postcss\char`\"{} engine is much more reliable. The \char`\"{}rework\char`\"{} engine will still work for now but will be removed in the next major version.

Remove the {\ttfamily keep\+Query} option if you are using it.

Remove the {\ttfamily absolute} option, webpack should work fine without it. If you have a specific need to rebase {\ttfamily url()} then you should use a separate loader.

If you use a custom {\ttfamily join} function then you will need to refactor it to the new API. Refer to the advanced usage documentation.

If you wish to still use {\ttfamily engine\+: \char`\"{}rework\char`\"{}} then note that {\ttfamily rework} and {\ttfamily rework-\/visit} packages are now {\ttfamily peer\+Dependencies} that must be explicitly installed by you.\hypertarget{md__c___users_vaishnavi_jadhav__desktop__developer_code_mean_stack_example_client_node_modules_r3650b38881817f5bb32516590cb30276_autotoc_md11861}{}\doxysection{Version 3}\label{md__c___users_vaishnavi_jadhav__desktop__developer_code_mean_stack_example_client_node_modules_r3650b38881817f5bb32516590cb30276_autotoc_md11861}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Use {\ttfamily postcss} parser by default. This is long overdue as the old {\ttfamily rework} parser doesn\textquotesingle{}t cope with modern css.
\item Lots of automated tests running actual webpack builds. If you have an interesting use-\/case let me know.
\end{DoxyItemize}

{\bfseries{Breaking Changes}}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Multiple options changed or deprecated.
\item Removed file search \char`\"{}magic\char`\"{} in favour of {\ttfamily join} option.
\item Errors always fail and are no longer swallowed.
\item Processing absolute asset paths requires {\ttfamily root} option to be set.
\end{DoxyItemize}

Initially set option `engine\+: \textquotesingle{}rework'{\ttfamily for parity with your existing build. Once working you can remove this option $\ast$$\ast$or$\ast$$\ast$ set}engine\+: \textquotesingle{}postcss\textquotesingle{}\`{} explicitly.

Retain {\ttfamily keep\+Query} option if you are already using it.

The {\ttfamily root} option now has a different meaning. Previously it limited file search. Now it is the base path for absolute or root-\/relative URIs, consistent with {\ttfamily css-\/loader}. If you are already using it you can probably remove it.

If you build on Windows platform {\bfseries{and}} your content contains absolute asset paths, then {\ttfamily css-\/loader} could fail. The {\ttfamily root} option here may fix the URIs before they get to {\ttfamily css-\/loader}. Try to leave it unspecified, otherwise (windows only) set to empty string `root\+: '\textquotesingle{}\`{}.
