Make sure you are using the native Python version in OSX. If you use a Mac\+Ports of Home\+Brew version, you may run into problems.

If you have issues with {\ttfamily execvp}, be sure to check your {\ttfamily \$\+PYTHON} environment variable. If it is not set to the native version, unset it and try again.
