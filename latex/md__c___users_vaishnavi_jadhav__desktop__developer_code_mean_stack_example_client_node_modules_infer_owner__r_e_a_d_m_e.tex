This module endeavors to be as performant as possible. Parallel requests for ownership of the same path will only stat the directories one time.\hypertarget{md__c___users_vaishnavi_jadhav__desktop__developer_code_mean_stack_example_client_node_modules_infer_owner__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md6652}{}\doxysection{API}\label{md__c___users_vaishnavi_jadhav__desktop__developer_code_mean_stack_example_client_node_modules_infer_owner__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md6652}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily infer\+Owner(path) -\/\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>} Promise\texorpdfstring{$<$}{<}\{ uid, gid \}\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>}}

If the path exists, return its uid and gid. If it does not, look to its parent, then its grandparent, and so on.
\item {\ttfamily infer\+Owner(path) -\/\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>} \{ uid, gid \}}

Sync form of {\ttfamily infer\+Owner(path)}.
\item {\ttfamily infer\+Owner.\+clear\+Cache()}

Delete all cached ownership information and in-\/flight tracking.
