\DoxyCodeLine{"{}projects"{}: \{}
\DoxyCodeLine{  "{}app"{}: \{}
\DoxyCodeLine{    // ...}
\DoxyCodeLine{    "{}architect"{}: \{}
\DoxyCodeLine{      // ...}
\DoxyCodeLine{      "{}build-\/webpack"{}: \{}
\DoxyCodeLine{        "{}builder"{}: "{}@angular-\/devkit/build-\/webpack:webpack"{},}
\DoxyCodeLine{        "{}options"{}: \{}
\DoxyCodeLine{          "{}webpackConfig"{}: "{}webpack.config.js"{}}
\DoxyCodeLine{        \}}
\DoxyCodeLine{      \},}
\DoxyCodeLine{      "{}serve-\/webpack"{}: \{}
\DoxyCodeLine{        "{}builder"{}: "{}@angular-\/devkit/build-\/webpack:webpack-\/dev-\/server"{},}
\DoxyCodeLine{        "{}options"{}: \{}
\DoxyCodeLine{          "{}webpackConfig"{}: "{}webpack.config.js"{}}
\DoxyCodeLine{        \}}
\DoxyCodeLine{      \}}
\DoxyCodeLine{    \}}

\end{DoxyCode}



\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item run {\ttfamily ng run app\+:build-\/webpack} to build, and {\ttfamily ng run app\+:serve-\/webpack} to serve.
\end{DoxyItemize}

All options, including {\ttfamily watch} and {\ttfamily stats}, are looked up inside the webpack configuration.
