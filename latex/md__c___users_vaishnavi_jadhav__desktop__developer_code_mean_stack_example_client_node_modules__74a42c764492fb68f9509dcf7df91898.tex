A library is a type of project that does not run independently. The library skeleton created by this command is placed by default in the {\ttfamily /projects} folder, and has {\ttfamily type} of \char`\"{}library\char`\"{}.

You can build a new library using the {\ttfamily ng build} command, run unit tests for it using the {\ttfamily ng test} command, and lint it using the {\ttfamily ng lint} command.
