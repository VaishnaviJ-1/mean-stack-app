\href{./benchmarks}{\texttt{ Fast}} and full-\/featured Tar for Node.\+js

The API is designed to mimic the behavior of {\ttfamily tar(1)} on unix systems. If you are familiar with how tar works, most of this will hopefully be straightforward for you. If not, then hopefully this module can teach you useful unix skills that may come in handy someday \+:)\hypertarget{md__c___users_vaishnavi_jadhav__desktop__developer_code_mean_stack_example_client_node_modules_tar__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md14357}{}\doxysection{Background}\label{md__c___users_vaishnavi_jadhav__desktop__developer_code_mean_stack_example_client_node_modules_tar__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md14357}
A \char`\"{}tar file\char`\"{} or \char`\"{}tarball\char`\"{} is an archive of file system entries (directories, files, links, etc.) The name comes from \char`\"{}tape archive\char`\"{}. If you run {\ttfamily man tar} on almost any Unix command line, you\textquotesingle{}ll learn quite a bit about what it can do, and its history.

Tar has 5 main top-\/level commands\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily c} Create an archive
\item {\ttfamily r} Replace entries within an archive
\item {\ttfamily u} Update entries within an archive (ie, replace if they\textquotesingle{}re newer)
\item {\ttfamily t} List out the contents of an archive
\item {\ttfamily x} Extract an archive to disk
\end{DoxyItemize}

The other flags and options modify how this top level function works.\hypertarget{md__c___users_vaishnavi_jadhav__desktop__developer_code_mean_stack_example_client_node_modules_tar__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md14358}{}\doxysection{High-\/\+Level API}\label{md__c___users_vaishnavi_jadhav__desktop__developer_code_mean_stack_example_client_node_modules_tar__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md14358}
These 5 functions are the high-\/level API. All of them have a single-\/character name (for unix nerds familiar with {\ttfamily tar(1)}) as well as a long name (for everyone else).

All the high-\/level functions take the following arguments, all three of which are optional and may be omitted.


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item {\ttfamily options} -\/ An optional object specifying various options
\item {\ttfamily paths} -\/ An array of paths to add or extract
\item {\ttfamily callback} -\/ Called when the command is completed, if async. (If sync or no file specified, providing a callback throws a {\ttfamily Type\+Error}.)
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

If the command is sync (ie, if {\ttfamily options.\+sync=true}), then the callback is not allowed, since the action will be completed immediately.

If a {\ttfamily file} argument is specified, and the command is async, then a {\ttfamily Promise} is returned. In this case, if async, a callback may be provided which is called when the command is completed.

If a {\ttfamily file} option is not specified, then a stream is returned. For {\ttfamily create}, this is a readable stream of the generated archive. For {\ttfamily list} and {\ttfamily extract} this is a writable stream that an archive should be written into. If a file is not specified, then a callback is not allowed, because you\textquotesingle{}re already getting a stream to work with.

{\ttfamily replace} and {\ttfamily update} only work on existing archives, and so require a {\ttfamily file} argument.

Sync commands without a file argument return a stream that acts on its input immediately in the same tick. For readable streams, this means that all of the data is immediately available by calling {\ttfamily stream.\+read()}. For writable streams, it will be acted upon as soon as it is provided, but this can be at any time.\hypertarget{md__c___users_vaishnavi_jadhav__desktop__developer_code_mean_stack_example_client_node_modules_tar__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md14359}{}\doxysubsection{Warnings and Errors}\label{md__c___users_vaishnavi_jadhav__desktop__developer_code_mean_stack_example_client_node_modules_tar__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md14359}
Tar emits warnings and errors for recoverable and unrecoverable situations, respectively. In many cases, a warning only affects a single entry in an archive, or is simply informing you that it\textquotesingle{}s modifying an entry to comply with the settings provided.

Unrecoverable warnings will always raise an error (ie, emit `\textquotesingle{}error'\`{} on streaming actions, throw for non-\/streaming sync actions, reject the returned Promise for non-\/streaming async operations, or call a provided callback with an {\ttfamily Error} as the first argument). Recoverable errors will raise an error only if {\ttfamily strict\+: true} is set in the options.

Respond to (recoverable) warnings by listening to the {\ttfamily warn} event. Handlers receive 3 arguments\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily code} String. One of the error codes below. This may not match {\ttfamily data.\+code}, which preserves the original error code from fs and zlib.
\item {\ttfamily message} String. More details about the error.
\item {\ttfamily data} Metadata about the error. An {\ttfamily Error} object for errors raised by fs and zlib. All fields are attached to errors raisd by tar. Typically contains the following fields, as relevant\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily tar\+Code} The tar error code.
\item {\ttfamily code} Either the tar error code, or the error code set by the underlying system.
\item {\ttfamily file} The archive file being read or written.
\item {\ttfamily cwd} Working directory for creation and extraction operations.
\item {\ttfamily entry} The entry object (if it could be created) for {\ttfamily TAR\+\_\+\+ENTRY\+\_\+\+INFO}, {\ttfamily TAR\+\_\+\+ENTRY\+\_\+\+INVALID}, and {\ttfamily TAR\+\_\+\+ENTRY\+\_\+\+ERROR} warnings.
\item {\ttfamily header} The header object (if it could be created, and the entry could not be created) for {\ttfamily TAR\+\_\+\+ENTRY\+\_\+\+INFO} and {\ttfamily TAR\+\_\+\+ENTRY\+\_\+\+INVALID} warnings.
\item {\ttfamily recoverable} Boolean. If {\ttfamily false}, then the warning will emit an {\ttfamily error}, even in non-\/strict mode.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{md__c___users_vaishnavi_jadhav__desktop__developer_code_mean_stack_example_client_node_modules_tar__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md14360}{}\doxysubsubsection{Error Codes}\label{md__c___users_vaishnavi_jadhav__desktop__developer_code_mean_stack_example_client_node_modules_tar__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md14360}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily TAR\+\_\+\+ENTRY\+\_\+\+INFO} An informative error indicating that an entry is being modified, but otherwise processed normally. For example, removing {\ttfamily /} or {\ttfamily C\+:\textbackslash{}} from absolute paths if {\ttfamily preserve\+Paths} is not set.
\item {\ttfamily TAR\+\_\+\+ENTRY\+\_\+\+INVALID} An indication that a given entry is not a valid tar archive entry, and will be skipped. This occurs when\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item a checksum fails,
\item a {\ttfamily linkpath} is missing for a link type, or
\item a {\ttfamily linkpath} is provided for a non-\/link type.
\end{DoxyItemize}

If every entry in a parsed archive raises an {\ttfamily TAR\+\_\+\+ENTRY\+\_\+\+INVALID} error, then the archive is presumed to be unrecoverably broken, and {\ttfamily TAR\+\_\+\+BAD\+\_\+\+ARCHIVE} will be raised.
\item {\ttfamily TAR\+\_\+\+ENTRY\+\_\+\+ERROR} The entry appears to be a valid tar archive entry, but encountered an error which prevented it from being unpacked. This occurs when\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item an unrecoverable fs error happens during unpacking,
\item an entry has {\ttfamily ..} in the path and {\ttfamily preserve\+Paths} is not set, or
\item an entry is extracting through a symbolic link, when {\ttfamily preserve\+Paths} is not set.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily TAR\+\_\+\+ENTRY\+\_\+\+UNSUPPORTED} An indication that a given entry is a valid archive entry, but of a type that is unsupported, and so will be skipped in archive creation or extracting.
\item {\ttfamily TAR\+\_\+\+ABORT} When parsing gzipped-\/encoded archives, the parser will abort the parse process raise a warning for any zlib errors encountered. Aborts are considered unrecoverable for both parsing and unpacking.
\item {\ttfamily TAR\+\_\+\+BAD\+\_\+\+ARCHIVE} The archive file is totally hosed. This can happen for a number of reasons, and always occurs at the end of a parse or extract\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item An entry body was truncated before seeing the full number of bytes.
\item The archive contained only invalid entries, indicating that it is likely not an archive, or at least, not an archive this library can parse.
\end{DoxyItemize}

{\ttfamily TAR\+\_\+\+BAD\+\_\+\+ARCHIVE} is considered informative for parse operations, but unrecoverable for extraction. Note that, if encountered at the end of an extraction, tar WILL still have extracted as much it could from the archive, so there may be some garbage files to clean up.
\end{DoxyItemize}

Errors that occur deeper in the system (ie, either the filesystem or zlib) will have their error codes left intact, and a {\ttfamily tar\+Code} matching one of the above will be added to the warning metadata or the raised error object.

Errors generated by tar will have one of the above codes set as the {\ttfamily error.\+code} field as well, but since errors originating in zlib or fs will have their original codes, it\textquotesingle{}s better to read {\ttfamily error.\+tar\+Code} if you wish to see how tar is handling the issue.\hypertarget{md__c___users_vaishnavi_jadhav__desktop__developer_code_mean_stack_example_client_node_modules_tar__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md14361}{}\doxysubsection{Examples}\label{md__c___users_vaishnavi_jadhav__desktop__developer_code_mean_stack_example_client_node_modules_tar__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md14361}
The API mimics the {\ttfamily tar(1)} command line functionality, with aliases for more human-\/readable option and function names. The goal is that if you know how to use {\ttfamily tar(1)} in Unix, then you know how to use `require(\textquotesingle{}tar')\`{} in Java\+Script.

To replicate {\ttfamily tar czf my-\/tarball.\+tgz files and folders}, you\textquotesingle{}d do\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{tar.c(}
\DoxyCodeLine{  \{}
\DoxyCodeLine{    gzip: <true|gzip options>,}
\DoxyCodeLine{    file: 'my-\/tarball.tgz'}
\DoxyCodeLine{  \},}
\DoxyCodeLine{  ['some', 'files', 'and', 'folders']}
\DoxyCodeLine{).then(\_ => \{ .. tarball has been created .. \})}

\end{DoxyCode}


To replicate {\ttfamily tar cz files and folders \texorpdfstring{$>$}{>} my-\/tarball.\+tgz}, you\textquotesingle{}d do\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{tar.c( // or tar.create}
\DoxyCodeLine{  \{}
\DoxyCodeLine{    gzip: <true|gzip options>}
\DoxyCodeLine{  \},}
\DoxyCodeLine{  ['some', 'files', 'and', 'folders']}
\DoxyCodeLine{).pipe(fs.createWriteStream('my-\/tarball.tgz'))}

\end{DoxyCode}


To replicate {\ttfamily tar xf my-\/tarball.\+tgz} you\textquotesingle{}d do\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{tar.x(  // or tar.extract(}
\DoxyCodeLine{  \{}
\DoxyCodeLine{    file: 'my-\/tarball.tgz'}
\DoxyCodeLine{  \}}
\DoxyCodeLine{).then(\_=> \{ .. tarball has been dumped in cwd .. \})}

\end{DoxyCode}


To replicate {\ttfamily cat my-\/tarball.\+tgz $\vert$ tar x -\/C some-\/dir -\/-\/strip=1}\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{fs.createReadStream('my-\/tarball.tgz').pipe(}
\DoxyCodeLine{  tar.x(\{}
\DoxyCodeLine{    strip: 1,}
\DoxyCodeLine{    C: 'some-\/dir' // alias for cwd:'some-\/dir', also ok}
\DoxyCodeLine{  \})}
\DoxyCodeLine{)}

\end{DoxyCode}


To replicate {\ttfamily tar tf my-\/tarball.\+tgz}, do this\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{tar.t(\{}
\DoxyCodeLine{  file: 'my-\/tarball.tgz',}
\DoxyCodeLine{  onentry: entry => \{ .. do whatever with it .. \}}
\DoxyCodeLine{\})}

\end{DoxyCode}


To replicate {\ttfamily cat my-\/tarball.\+tgz $\vert$ tar t} do\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{fs.createReadStream('my-\/tarball.tgz')}
\DoxyCodeLine{  .pipe(tar.t())}
\DoxyCodeLine{  .on('entry', entry => \{ .. do whatever with it .. \})}

\end{DoxyCode}


To do anything synchronous, add {\ttfamily sync\+: true} to the options. Note that sync functions don\textquotesingle{}t take a callback and don\textquotesingle{}t return a promise. When the function returns, it\textquotesingle{}s already done. Sync methods without a file argument return a sync stream, which flushes immediately. But, of course, it still won\textquotesingle{}t be done until you {\ttfamily .end()} it.

To filter entries, add {\ttfamily filter\+: \texorpdfstring{$<$}{<}function\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>}} to the options. Tar-\/creating methods call the filter with {\ttfamily filter(path, stat)}. Tar-\/reading methods (including extraction) call the filter with {\ttfamily filter(path, entry)}. The filter is called in the {\ttfamily this}-\/context of the {\ttfamily Pack} or {\ttfamily Unpack} stream object.

The arguments list to {\ttfamily tar t} and {\ttfamily tar x} specify a list of filenames to extract or list, so they\textquotesingle{}re equivalent to a filter that tests if the file is in the list.

For those who {\itshape aren\textquotesingle{}t} fans of tar\textquotesingle{}s single-\/character command names\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{tar.c === tar.create}
\DoxyCodeLine{tar.r === tar.replace (appends to archive, file is required)}
\DoxyCodeLine{tar.u === tar.update (appends if newer, file is required)}
\DoxyCodeLine{tar.x === tar.extract}
\DoxyCodeLine{tar.t === tar.list}

\end{DoxyCode}


Keep reading for all the command descriptions and options, as well as the low-\/level API that they are built on.\hypertarget{md__c___users_vaishnavi_jadhav__desktop__developer_code_mean_stack_example_client_node_modules_tar__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md14362}{}\doxysubsection{tar.\+c(options, file\+List, callback) \mbox{[}alias\+: tar.\+create\mbox{]}}\label{md__c___users_vaishnavi_jadhav__desktop__developer_code_mean_stack_example_client_node_modules_tar__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md14362}
Create a tarball archive.

The {\ttfamily file\+List} is an array of paths to add to the tarball. Adding a directory also adds its children recursively.

An entry in {\ttfamily file\+List} that starts with an {\ttfamily @} symbol is a tar archive whose entries will be added. To add a file that starts with {\ttfamily @}, prepend it with {\ttfamily ./}.

The following options are supported\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily file} Write the tarball archive to the specified filename. If this is specified, then the callback will be fired when the file has been written, and a promise will be returned that resolves when the file is written. If a filename is not specified, then a Readable Stream will be returned which will emit the file data. \mbox{[}Alias\+: {\ttfamily f}\mbox{]}
\item {\ttfamily sync} Act synchronously. If this is set, then any provided file will be fully written after the call to {\ttfamily tar.\+c}. If this is set, and a file is not provided, then the resulting stream will already have the data ready to {\ttfamily read} or `emit(\textquotesingle{}data')\`{} as soon as you request it.
\item {\ttfamily onwarn} A function that will get called with {\ttfamily (code, message, data)} for any warnings encountered. (See \char`\"{}\+Warnings and Errors\char`\"{})
\item {\ttfamily strict} Treat warnings as crash-\/worthy errors. Default false.
\item {\ttfamily cwd} The current working directory for creating the archive. Defaults to {\ttfamily process.\+cwd()}. \mbox{[}Alias\+: {\ttfamily C}\mbox{]}
\item {\ttfamily prefix} A path portion to prefix onto the entries in the archive.
\item {\ttfamily gzip} Set to any truthy value to create a gzipped archive, or an object with settings for {\ttfamily zlib.\+Gzip()} \mbox{[}Alias\+: {\ttfamily z}\mbox{]}
\item {\ttfamily filter} A function that gets called with {\ttfamily (path, stat)} for each entry being added. Return {\ttfamily true} to add the entry to the archive, or {\ttfamily false} to omit it.
\item {\ttfamily portable} Omit metadata that is system-\/specific\+: {\ttfamily ctime}, {\ttfamily atime}, {\ttfamily uid}, {\ttfamily gid}, {\ttfamily uname}, {\ttfamily gname}, {\ttfamily dev}, {\ttfamily ino}, and {\ttfamily nlink}. Note that {\ttfamily mtime} is still included, because this is necessary for other time-\/based operations. Additionally, {\ttfamily mode} is set to a \char`\"{}reasonable   default\char`\"{} for most unix systems, based on a {\ttfamily umask} value of {\ttfamily 0o22}.
\item {\ttfamily preserve\+Paths} Allow absolute paths. By default, {\ttfamily /} is stripped from absolute paths. \mbox{[}Alias\+: {\ttfamily P}\mbox{]}
\item {\ttfamily mode} The mode to set on the created file archive
\item {\ttfamily no\+Dir\+Recurse} Do not recursively archive the contents of directories. \mbox{[}Alias\+: {\ttfamily n}\mbox{]}
\item {\ttfamily follow} Set to true to pack the targets of symbolic links. Without this option, symbolic links are archived as such. \mbox{[}Alias\+: {\ttfamily L}, {\ttfamily h}\mbox{]}
\item {\ttfamily no\+Pax} Suppress pax extended headers. Note that this means that long paths and linkpaths will be truncated, and large or negative numeric values may be interpreted incorrectly.
\item {\ttfamily no\+Mtime} Set to true to omit writing {\ttfamily mtime} values for entries. Note that this prevents using other mtime-\/based features like {\ttfamily tar.\+update} or the {\ttfamily keep\+Newer} option with the resulting tar archive. \mbox{[}Alias\+: {\ttfamily m}, {\ttfamily no-\/mtime}\mbox{]}
\item {\ttfamily mtime} Set to a {\ttfamily Date} object to force a specific {\ttfamily mtime} for everything added to the archive. Overridden by {\ttfamily no\+Mtime}.
\end{DoxyItemize}

The following options are mostly internal, but can be modified in some advanced use cases, such as re-\/using caches between runs.


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily link\+Cache} A Map object containing the device and inode value for any file whose nlink is \texorpdfstring{$>$}{>} 1, to identify hard links.
\item {\ttfamily stat\+Cache} A Map object that caches calls {\ttfamily lstat}.
\item {\ttfamily readdir\+Cache} A Map object that caches calls to {\ttfamily readdir}.
\item {\ttfamily jobs} A number specifying how many concurrent jobs to run. Defaults to 4.
\item {\ttfamily max\+Read\+Size} The maximum buffer size for {\ttfamily fs.\+read()} operations. Defaults to 16 MB.
\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{md__c___users_vaishnavi_jadhav__desktop__developer_code_mean_stack_example_client_node_modules_tar__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md14363}{}\doxysubsection{tar.\+x(options, file\+List, callback) \mbox{[}alias\+: tar.\+extract\mbox{]}}\label{md__c___users_vaishnavi_jadhav__desktop__developer_code_mean_stack_example_client_node_modules_tar__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md14363}
Extract a tarball archive.

The {\ttfamily file\+List} is an array of paths to extract from the tarball. If no paths are provided, then all the entries are extracted.

If the archive is gzipped, then tar will detect this and unzip it.

Note that all directories that are created will be forced to be writable, readable, and listable by their owner, to avoid cases where a directory prevents extraction of child entries by virtue of its mode.

Most extraction errors will cause a {\ttfamily warn} event to be emitted. If the {\ttfamily cwd} is missing, or not a directory, then the extraction will fail completely.

The following options are supported\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily cwd} Extract files relative to the specified directory. Defaults to {\ttfamily process.\+cwd()}. If provided, this must exist and must be a directory. \mbox{[}Alias\+: {\ttfamily C}\mbox{]}
\item {\ttfamily file} The archive file to extract. If not specified, then a Writable stream is returned where the archive data should be written. \mbox{[}Alias\+: {\ttfamily f}\mbox{]}
\item {\ttfamily sync} Create files and directories synchronously.
\item {\ttfamily strict} Treat warnings as crash-\/worthy errors. Default false.
\item {\ttfamily filter} A function that gets called with {\ttfamily (path, entry)} for each entry being unpacked. Return {\ttfamily true} to unpack the entry from the archive, or {\ttfamily false} to skip it.
\item {\ttfamily newer} Set to true to keep the existing file on disk if it\textquotesingle{}s newer than the file in the archive. \mbox{[}Alias\+: {\ttfamily keep-\/newer}, {\ttfamily keep-\/newer-\/files}\mbox{]}
\item {\ttfamily keep} Do not overwrite existing files. In particular, if a file appears more than once in an archive, later copies will not overwrite earlier copies. \mbox{[}Alias\+: {\ttfamily k}, {\ttfamily keep-\/existing}\mbox{]}
\item {\ttfamily preserve\+Paths} Allow absolute paths, paths containing {\ttfamily ..}, and extracting through symbolic links. By default, {\ttfamily /} is stripped from absolute paths, {\ttfamily ..} paths are not extracted, and any file whose location would be modified by a symbolic link is not extracted. \mbox{[}Alias\+: {\ttfamily P}\mbox{]}
\item {\ttfamily unlink} Unlink files before creating them. Without this option, tar overwrites existing files, which preserves existing hardlinks. With this option, existing hardlinks will be broken, as will any symlink that would affect the location of an extracted file. \mbox{[}Alias\+: {\ttfamily U}\mbox{]}
\item {\ttfamily strip} Remove the specified number of leading path elements. Pathnames with fewer elements will be silently skipped. Note that the pathname is edited after applying the filter, but before security checks. \mbox{[}Alias\+: {\ttfamily strip-\/components}, {\ttfamily strip\+Components}\mbox{]}
\item {\ttfamily onwarn} A function that will get called with {\ttfamily (code, message, data)} for any warnings encountered. (See \char`\"{}\+Warnings and Errors\char`\"{})
\item {\ttfamily preserve\+Owner} If true, tar will set the {\ttfamily uid} and {\ttfamily gid} of extracted entries to the {\ttfamily uid} and {\ttfamily gid} fields in the archive. This defaults to true when run as root, and false otherwise. If false, then files and directories will be set with the owner and group of the user running the process. This is similar to {\ttfamily -\/p} in {\ttfamily tar(1)}, but ACLs and other system-\/specific data is never unpacked in this implementation, and modes are set by default already. \mbox{[}Alias\+: {\ttfamily p}\mbox{]}
\item {\ttfamily uid} Set to a number to force ownership of all extracted files and folders, and all implicitly created directories, to be owned by the specified user id, regardless of the {\ttfamily uid} field in the archive. Cannot be used along with {\ttfamily preserve\+Owner}. Requires also setting a {\ttfamily gid} option.
\item {\ttfamily gid} Set to a number to force ownership of all extracted files and folders, and all implicitly created directories, to be owned by the specified group id, regardless of the {\ttfamily gid} field in the archive. Cannot be used along with {\ttfamily preserve\+Owner}. Requires also setting a {\ttfamily uid} option.
\item {\ttfamily no\+Mtime} Set to true to omit writing {\ttfamily mtime} value for extracted entries. \mbox{[}Alias\+: {\ttfamily m}, {\ttfamily no-\/mtime}\mbox{]}
\item {\ttfamily transform} Provide a function that takes an {\ttfamily entry} object, and returns a stream, or any falsey value. If a stream is provided, then that stream\textquotesingle{}s data will be written instead of the contents of the archive entry. If a falsey value is provided, then the entry is written to disk as normal. (To exclude items from extraction, use the {\ttfamily filter} option described above.)
\item {\ttfamily onentry} A function that gets called with {\ttfamily (entry)} for each entry that passes the filter.
\item {\ttfamily onwarn} A function that will get called with {\ttfamily (code, message, data)} for any warnings encountered. (See \char`\"{}\+Warnings and Errors\char`\"{})
\item {\ttfamily no\+Chmod} Set to true to omit calling {\ttfamily fs.\+chmod()} to ensure that the extracted file matches the entry mode. This also suppresses the call to {\ttfamily process.\+umask()} to determine the default umask value, since tar will extract with whatever mode is provided, and let the process {\ttfamily umask} apply normally.
\end{DoxyItemize}

The following options are mostly internal, but can be modified in some advanced use cases, such as re-\/using caches between runs.


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily max\+Read\+Size} The maximum buffer size for {\ttfamily fs.\+read()} operations. Defaults to 16 MB.
\item {\ttfamily umask} Filter the modes of entries like {\ttfamily process.\+umask()}.
\item {\ttfamily dmode} Default mode for directories
\item {\ttfamily fmode} Default mode for files
\item {\ttfamily dir\+Cache} A Map object of which directories exist.
\item {\ttfamily max\+Meta\+Entry\+Size} The maximum size of meta entries that is supported. Defaults to 1 MB.
\end{DoxyItemize}

Note that using an asynchronous stream type with the {\ttfamily transform} option will cause undefined behavior in sync extractions. \href{http://npm.im/minipass}{\texttt{ Mini\+Pass}}-\/based streams are designed for this use case.\hypertarget{md__c___users_vaishnavi_jadhav__desktop__developer_code_mean_stack_example_client_node_modules_tar__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md14364}{}\doxysubsection{tar.\+t(options, file\+List, callback) \mbox{[}alias\+: tar.\+list\mbox{]}}\label{md__c___users_vaishnavi_jadhav__desktop__developer_code_mean_stack_example_client_node_modules_tar__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md14364}
List the contents of a tarball archive.

The {\ttfamily file\+List} is an array of paths to list from the tarball. If no paths are provided, then all the entries are listed.

If the archive is gzipped, then tar will detect this and unzip it.

Returns an event emitter that emits {\ttfamily entry} events with {\ttfamily tar.\+Read\+Entry} objects. However, they don\textquotesingle{}t emit `\textquotesingle{}data'{\ttfamily or}\textquotesingle{}end\textquotesingle{}\`{} events. (If you want to get actual readable entries, use the {\ttfamily tar.\+Parse} class instead.)

The following options are supported\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily cwd} Extract files relative to the specified directory. Defaults to {\ttfamily process.\+cwd()}. \mbox{[}Alias\+: {\ttfamily C}\mbox{]}
\item {\ttfamily file} The archive file to list. If not specified, then a Writable stream is returned where the archive data should be written. \mbox{[}Alias\+: {\ttfamily f}\mbox{]}
\item {\ttfamily sync} Read the specified file synchronously. (This has no effect when a file option isn\textquotesingle{}t specified, because entries are emitted as fast as they are parsed from the stream anyway.)
\item {\ttfamily strict} Treat warnings as crash-\/worthy errors. Default false.
\item {\ttfamily filter} A function that gets called with {\ttfamily (path, entry)} for each entry being listed. Return {\ttfamily true} to emit the entry from the archive, or {\ttfamily false} to skip it.
\item {\ttfamily onentry} A function that gets called with {\ttfamily (entry)} for each entry that passes the filter. This is important for when both {\ttfamily file} and {\ttfamily sync} are set, because it will be called synchronously.
\item {\ttfamily max\+Read\+Size} The maximum buffer size for {\ttfamily fs.\+read()} operations. Defaults to 16 MB.

Add files to an archive if they are newer than the entry already in the tarball archive.

The {\ttfamily file\+List} is an array of paths to add to the tarball. Adding a directory also adds its children recursively.

An entry in {\ttfamily file\+List} that starts with an {\ttfamily @} symbol is a tar archive whose entries will be added. To add a file that starts with {\ttfamily @}, prepend it with {\ttfamily ./}.

The following options are supported\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily file} Required. Write the tarball archive to the specified filename. \mbox{[}Alias\+: {\ttfamily f}\mbox{]}
\item {\ttfamily sync} Act synchronously. If this is set, then any provided file will be fully written after the call to {\ttfamily tar.\+c}.
\item {\ttfamily onwarn} A function that will get called with {\ttfamily (code, message, data)} for any warnings encountered. (See \char`\"{}\+Warnings and Errors\char`\"{})
\item {\ttfamily strict} Treat warnings as crash-\/worthy errors. Default false.
\item {\ttfamily cwd} The current working directory for adding entries to the archive. Defaults to {\ttfamily process.\+cwd()}. \mbox{[}Alias\+: {\ttfamily C}\mbox{]}
\item {\ttfamily prefix} A path portion to prefix onto the entries in the archive.
\item {\ttfamily gzip} Set to any truthy value to create a gzipped archive, or an object with settings for {\ttfamily zlib.\+Gzip()} \mbox{[}Alias\+: {\ttfamily z}\mbox{]}
\item {\ttfamily filter} A function that gets called with {\ttfamily (path, stat)} for each entry being added. Return {\ttfamily true} to add the entry to the archive, or {\ttfamily false} to omit it.
\item {\ttfamily portable} Omit metadata that is system-\/specific\+: {\ttfamily ctime}, {\ttfamily atime}, {\ttfamily uid}, {\ttfamily gid}, {\ttfamily uname}, {\ttfamily gname}, {\ttfamily dev}, {\ttfamily ino}, and {\ttfamily nlink}. Note that {\ttfamily mtime} is still included, because this is necessary for other time-\/based operations.

\item {\ttfamily follow} Set to true to pack the targets of symbolic links. Without this option, symbolic links are archived as such. \mbox{[}Alias\+: {\ttfamily L}, {\ttfamily h}\mbox{]}
\item {\ttfamily no\+Pax} Suppress pax extended headers. Note that this means that long paths and linkpaths will be truncated, and large or negative numeric values may be interpreted incorrectly.
\item {\ttfamily no\+Mtime} Set to true to omit writing {\ttfamily mtime} values for entries. Note that this prevents using other mtime-\/based features like {\ttfamily tar.\+update} or the {\ttfamily keep\+Newer} option with the resulting tar archive. \mbox{[}Alias\+: {\ttfamily m}, {\ttfamily no-\/mtime}\mbox{]}

Add files to an existing archive. Because later entries override earlier entries, this effectively replaces any existing entries.

The {\ttfamily file\+List} is an array of paths to add to the tarball. Adding a directory also adds its children recursively.

A writable stream that unpacks a tar archive onto the file system.

All the normal writable stream stuff is supported. {\ttfamily write()} and {\ttfamily end()} methods, `\textquotesingle{}drain'\`{} events, etc.

Note that all directories that are created will be forced to be writable, readable, and listable by their owner, to avoid cases where a directory prevents extraction of child entries by virtue of its mode.

`\textquotesingle{}close'\`{} is emitted when it\textquotesingle{}s done writing stuff to the file system.

Most unpack errors will cause a {\ttfamily warn} event to be emitted. If the {\ttfamily cwd} is missing, or not a directory, then an error will be emitted.\hypertarget{md__c___users_vaishnavi_jadhav__desktop__developer_code_mean_stack_example_client_node_modules_tar__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md14375}{}\doxysubsubsection{constructor(options)}\label{md__c___users_vaishnavi_jadhav__desktop__developer_code_mean_stack_example_client_node_modules_tar__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md14375}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily cwd} Extract files relative to the specified directory. Defaults to {\ttfamily process.\+cwd()}. If provided, this must exist and must be a directory.
\item {\ttfamily filter} A function that gets called with {\ttfamily (path, entry)} for each entry being unpacked. Return {\ttfamily true} to unpack the entry from the archive, or {\ttfamily false} to skip it.
\item {\ttfamily newer} Set to true to keep the existing file on disk if it\textquotesingle{}s newer than the file in the archive.
\item {\ttfamily keep} Do not overwrite existing files. In particular, if a file appears more than once in an archive, later copies will not overwrite earlier copies.
\item {\ttfamily preserve\+Paths} Allow absolute paths, paths containing {\ttfamily ..}, and extracting through symbolic links. By default, {\ttfamily /} is stripped from absolute paths, {\ttfamily ..} paths are not extracted, and any file whose location would be modified by a symbolic link is not extracted.
\item {\ttfamily unlink} Unlink files before creating them. Without this option, tar overwrites existing files, which preserves existing hardlinks. With this option, existing hardlinks will be broken, as will any symlink that would affect the location of an extracted file.
\item {\ttfamily strip} Remove the specified number of leading path elements. Pathnames with fewer elements will be silently skipped. Note that the pathname is edited after applying the filter, but before security checks.
\item {\ttfamily onwarn} A function that will get called with {\ttfamily (code, message, data)} for any warnings encountered. (See \char`\"{}\+Warnings and Errors\char`\"{})
\item {\ttfamily umask} Filter the modes of entries like {\ttfamily process.\+umask()}.
\item {\ttfamily dmode} Default mode for directories
\item {\ttfamily fmode} Default mode for files
\item {\ttfamily dir\+Cache} A Map object of which directories exist.
\item {\ttfamily max\+Meta\+Entry\+Size} The maximum size of meta entries that is supported. Defaults to 1 MB.
\item {\ttfamily preserve\+Owner} If true, tar will set the {\ttfamily uid} and {\ttfamily gid} of extracted entries to the {\ttfamily uid} and {\ttfamily gid} fields in the archive. This defaults to true when run as root, and false otherwise. If false, then files and directories will be set with the owner and group of the user running the process. This is similar to {\ttfamily -\/p} in {\ttfamily tar(1)}, but ACLs and other system-\/specific data is never unpacked in this implementation, and modes are set by default already.
\item {\ttfamily win32} True if on a windows platform. Causes behavior where filenames containing {\ttfamily \texorpdfstring{$<$}{<}$\vert$\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>}?} chars are converted to windows-\/compatible values while being unpacked.
\item {\ttfamily uid} Set to a number to force ownership of all extracted files and folders, and all implicitly created directories, to be owned by the specified user id, regardless of the {\ttfamily uid} field in the archive. Cannot be used along with {\ttfamily preserve\+Owner}. Requires also setting a {\ttfamily gid} option.
\item {\ttfamily gid} Set to a number to force ownership of all extracted files and folders, and all implicitly created directories, to be owned by the specified group id, regardless of the {\ttfamily gid} field in the archive. Cannot be used along with {\ttfamily preserve\+Owner}. Requires also setting a {\ttfamily uid} option.
\item {\ttfamily no\+Mtime} Set to true to omit writing {\ttfamily mtime} value for extracted entries.
\item {\ttfamily transform} Provide a function that takes an {\ttfamily entry} object, and returns a stream, or any falsey value. If a stream is provided, then that stream\textquotesingle{}s data will be written instead of the contents of the archive entry. If a falsey value is provided, then the entry is written to disk as normal. (To exclude items from extraction, use the {\ttfamily filter} option described above.)
\item {\ttfamily strict} Treat warnings as crash-\/worthy errors. Default false.
\item {\ttfamily onentry} A function that gets called with {\ttfamily (entry)} for each entry that passes the filter.
\item {\ttfamily onwarn} A function that will get called with {\ttfamily (code, message, data)} for any warnings encountered. (See \char`\"{}\+Warnings and Errors\char`\"{})
\item {\ttfamily no\+Chmod} Set to true to omit calling {\ttfamily fs.\+chmod()} to ensure that the extracted file matches the entry mode. This also suppresses the call to {\ttfamily process.\+umask()} to determine the default umask value, since tar will extract with whatever mode is provided, and let the process {\ttfamily umask} apply normally.

A writable stream that parses a tar archive stream. All the standard writable stream stuff is supported.

If the archive is gzipped, then tar will detect this and unzip it.

Emits `\textquotesingle{}entry'{\ttfamily events with}tar.\+Read\+Entry\`{} objects, which are themselves readable streams that you can pipe wherever.

Each {\ttfamily entry} will not emit until the one before it is flushed through, so make sure to either consume the data (with `on(\textquotesingle{}data', ...){\ttfamily or }.pipe(...){\ttfamily ) or throw it away with}.resume()\`{} to keep the stream flowing.\hypertarget{md__c___users_vaishnavi_jadhav__desktop__developer_code_mean_stack_example_client_node_modules_tar__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md14378}{}\doxysubsubsection{constructor(options)}\label{md__c___users_vaishnavi_jadhav__desktop__developer_code_mean_stack_example_client_node_modules_tar__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md14378}

Emits data for the Header, and for the Pax Extended Header if one is required, as well as any body data.

Creating a Write\+Entry for a directory does not also create Write\+Entry objects for all of the directory contents.

It has the following fields\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily path} The path field that will be written to the archive. By default, this is also the path from the cwd to the file system object.
\item {\ttfamily portable} Omit metadata that is system-\/specific\+: {\ttfamily ctime}, {\ttfamily atime}, {\ttfamily uid}, {\ttfamily gid}, {\ttfamily uname}, {\ttfamily gname}, {\ttfamily dev}, {\ttfamily ino}, and {\ttfamily nlink}. Note that {\ttfamily mtime} is still included, because this is necessary for other time-\/based operations. Additionally, {\ttfamily mode} is set to a \char`\"{}reasonable   default\char`\"{} for most unix systems, based on a {\ttfamily umask} value of {\ttfamily 0o22}.
\item {\ttfamily myuid} If supported, the uid of the user running the current process.
\item {\ttfamily myuser} The {\ttfamily env.\+USER} string if set, or `'\textquotesingle{}{\ttfamily .

Defaults to 1 MB.
\item {\ttfamily link\+Cache} A Map object containing the device and inode value for any file whose nlink is \texorpdfstring{$>$}{>} 1, to identify hard links.
\item {\ttfamily stat\+Cache} A Map object that caches calls {\ttfamily lstat}.
\item {\ttfamily preserve\+Paths} Allow absolute paths. By default, {\ttfamily /} is stripped from absolute paths.
\item {\ttfamily cwd} The current working directory for creating the archive. Defaults to {\ttfamily process.\+cwd()}.
\item {\ttfamily absolute} The absolute path to the entry on the filesystem. By default, this is {\ttfamily path.\+resolve(this.\+cwd, this.\+path)}, but it can be overridden explicitly.
\item {\ttfamily strict} Treat warnings as crash-\/worthy errors. Default false.
\item {\ttfamily win32} True if on a windows platform. Causes behavior where paths replace {\ttfamily \textbackslash{}} with {\ttfamily /} and filenames containing the windows-\/compatible forms of {\ttfamily \texorpdfstring{$<$}{<}$\vert$\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>}?\+:} characters are converted to actual {\ttfamily \texorpdfstring{$<$}{<}$\vert$\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>}?\+:} characters in the archive.
\item {\ttfamily no\+Pax} Suppress pax extended headers. Note that this means that long paths and linkpaths will be truncated, and large or negative numeric values may be interpreted incorrectly.
\item {\ttfamily no\+Mtime} Set to true to omit writing {\ttfamily mtime} values for entries. Note that this prevents using other mtime-\/based features like {\ttfamily tar.\+update} or the {\ttfamily keep\+Newer} option with the resulting tar archive.

{\ttfamily path} is the path of the entry as it is written in the archive.

The following options are supported\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily portable} Omit metadata that is system-\/specific\+: {\ttfamily ctime}, {\ttfamily atime}, {\ttfamily uid}, {\ttfamily gid}, {\ttfamily uname}, {\ttfamily gname}, {\ttfamily dev}, {\ttfamily ino}, and {\ttfamily nlink}. Note that {\ttfamily mtime} is still included, because this is necessary for other time-\/based operations. Additionally, {\ttfamily mode} is set to a \char`\"{}reasonable   default\char`\"{} for most unix systems, based on a {\ttfamily umask} value of {\ttfamily 0o22}.
\item {\ttfamily max\+Read\+Size} The maximum buffer size for {\ttfamily fs.\+read()} operations. Defaults to 1 MB.
\item {\ttfamily link\+Cache} A Map object containing the device and inode value for any file whose nlink is \texorpdfstring{$>$}{>} 1, to identify hard links.
\item {\ttfamily stat\+Cache} A Map object that caches calls {\ttfamily lstat}.
\item {\ttfamily preserve\+Paths} Allow absolute paths. By default, {\ttfamily /} is stripped from absolute paths.
\item {\ttfamily cwd} The current working directory for creating the archive. Defaults to {\ttfamily process.\+cwd()}.
\item {\ttfamily absolute} The absolute path to the entry on the filesystem. By default, this is {\ttfamily path.\+resolve(this.\+cwd, this.\+path)}, but it can be overridden explicitly.
\item {\ttfamily strict} Treat warnings as crash-\/worthy errors. Default false.
\item {\ttfamily win32} True if on a windows platform. Causes behavior where paths replace {\ttfamily \textbackslash{}} with {\ttfamily /}.
\item {\ttfamily onwarn} A function that will get called with {\ttfamily (code, message, data)} for any warnings encountered. (See \char`\"{}\+Warnings and Errors\char`\"{})
\item {\ttfamily no\+Mtime} Set to true to omit writing {\ttfamily mtime} values for entries. Note that this prevents using other mtime-\/based features like {\ttfamily tar.\+update} or the {\ttfamily keep\+Newer} option with the resulting tar archive.
\item {\ttfamily umask} Set to restrict the modes on the entries in the archive, somewhat like how umask works on file creation. Defaults to {\ttfamily process.\+umask()} on unix systems, or {\ttfamily 0o22} on Windows.

A class for reading and writing header blocks.

It has the following fields\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily null\+Block} True if decoding a block which is entirely composed of {\ttfamily 0x00} null bytes. (Useful because tar files are terminated by at least 2 null blocks.)
\item {\ttfamily cksum\+Valid} True if the checksum in the header is valid, false otherwise.
\item {\ttfamily need\+Pax} True if the values, as encoded, will require a Pax extended header.
\item {\ttfamily path} The path of the entry.
\item {\ttfamily mode} The 4 lowest-\/order octal digits of the file mode. That is, read/write/execute permissions for world, group, and owner, and the setuid, setgid, and sticky bits.
\item {\ttfamily uid} Numeric user id of the file owner
\item {\ttfamily gid} Numeric group id of the file owner
\item {\ttfamily size} Size of the file in bytes
\item {\ttfamily mtime} Modified time of the file
\item {\ttfamily cksum} The checksum of the header. This is generated by adding all the bytes of the header block, treating the checksum field itself as all ascii space characters (that is, {\ttfamily 0x20}).
\item {\ttfamily type} The human-\/readable name of the type of entry this represents, or the alphanumeric key if unknown.
\item {\ttfamily type\+Key} The alphanumeric key for the type of entry this header represents.
\item {\ttfamily linkpath} The target of Link and Symbolic\+Link entries.
\item {\ttfamily uname} Human-\/readable user name of the file owner
\item {\ttfamily gname} Human-\/readable group name of the file owner
\item {\ttfamily devmaj} The major portion of the device number. Always {\ttfamily 0} for files, directories, and links.
\item {\ttfamily devmin} The minor portion of the device number. Always {\ttfamily 0} for files, directories, and links.
\item {\ttfamily atime} File access time.
\item {\ttfamily ctime} File change time.

An object representing a set of key-\/value pairs in an Pax extended header entry.

It has the following fields. Where the same name is used, they have the same semantics as the tar.\+Header field of the same name.


\begin{DoxyItemize}
