The command takes an optional project name, as specified in the {\ttfamily projects} section of the {\ttfamily angular.\+json} workspace configuration file. When a project name is not supplied, executes the {\ttfamily e2e} builder for the default project.

To use the {\ttfamily ng e2e} command, use {\ttfamily ng add} to add a package that implements end-\/to-\/end testing capabilities. Adding the package automatically updates your workspace configuration, adding an {\ttfamily e2e} \href{guide/cli-builder}{\texttt{ CLI builder}}.
