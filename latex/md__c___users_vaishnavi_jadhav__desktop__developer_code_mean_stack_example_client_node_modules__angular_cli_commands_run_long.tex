Architect is the tool that the CLI uses to perform complex tasks such as compilation, according to provided configurations. The CLI commands run Architect targets such as {\ttfamily build}, {\ttfamily serve}, {\ttfamily test}, and {\ttfamily lint}. Each named target has a default configuration, specified by an \char`\"{}options\char`\"{} object, and an optional set of named alternate configurations in the \char`\"{}configurations\char`\"{} object.

For example, the \char`\"{}serve\char`\"{} target for a newly generated app has a predefined alternate configuration named \char`\"{}production\char`\"{}.

You can define new targets and their configuration options in the \char`\"{}architect\char`\"{} section of the {\ttfamily angular.\+json} file. If you do so, you can run them from the command line using the {\ttfamily ng run} command. Execute the command using the following format.


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{ng run project:target[:configuration]}

\end{DoxyCode}
