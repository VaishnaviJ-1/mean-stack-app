If you discover a security issue in webpack, please report it by sending an email to \href{mailto:webpack@opencollective.com}{\texttt{ webpack@opencollective.\+com}}.

This will allow us to assess the risk, and make a fix available before we add a bug report to the Git\+Hub repository.

Thanks for helping make webpack safe for everyone.
