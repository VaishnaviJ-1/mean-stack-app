Adds the npm package for a published library to your workspace, and configures the project in the current working directory (or the default project if you are not in a project directory) to use that library, as specified by the library\textquotesingle{}s schematic. For example, adding {\ttfamily @angular/pwa} configures your project for PWA support\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{ng add @angular/pwa}

\end{DoxyCode}


The default project is the value of {\ttfamily default\+Project} in {\ttfamily angular.\+json}.
