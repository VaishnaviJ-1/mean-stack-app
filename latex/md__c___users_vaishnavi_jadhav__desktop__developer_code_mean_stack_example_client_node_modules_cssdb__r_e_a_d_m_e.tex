\href{https://github.com/csstools/cssdb}{\texttt{ cssdb}} ranks CSS features by stages that reflect the real-\/life stability of new CSS features.

You can read an \href{https://fantasai.inkedblade.net/weblog/2011/inside-csswg/process}{\texttt{ inside view of the CSSWG}} to learn about the official (and unofficial) development stages of CSS specifications. In reality, specifications and browser implementations happen out of sync. For example, there are stable CSS features missing in all browsers, while other CSS features developed outside the \href{https://wiki.csswg.org/spec}{\texttt{ CSSWG}} have appeared in browsers behind flags. This is too ambiguous for the web development community, and a more accountable process is desired.
