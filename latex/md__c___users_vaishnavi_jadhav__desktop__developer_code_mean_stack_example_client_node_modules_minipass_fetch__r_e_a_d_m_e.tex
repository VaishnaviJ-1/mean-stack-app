An implementation of window.\+fetch in Node.\+js using Minipass streams

This is a fork (or more precisely, a reimplementation) of \href{http://npm.im/node-fetch}{\texttt{ node-\/fetch}}. All streams have been replaced with \href{http://npm.im/minipass}{\texttt{ minipass streams}}.

The goal of this module is to stay in sync with the API presented by {\ttfamily node-\/fetch}, with the exception of the streaming interface provided.\hypertarget{md__c___users_vaishnavi_jadhav__desktop__developer_code_mean_stack_example_client_node_modules_minipass_fetch__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md8779}{}\doxysection{Why}\label{md__c___users_vaishnavi_jadhav__desktop__developer_code_mean_stack_example_client_node_modules_minipass_fetch__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md8779}
Minipass streams are faster and more deterministic in their timing contract than node-\/core streams, making them a better fit for many server-\/side use cases.\hypertarget{md__c___users_vaishnavi_jadhav__desktop__developer_code_mean_stack_example_client_node_modules_minipass_fetch__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md8780}{}\doxysection{API}\label{md__c___users_vaishnavi_jadhav__desktop__developer_code_mean_stack_example_client_node_modules_minipass_fetch__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md8780}

Differences from {\ttfamily node-\/fetch} (and, by extension, from the What\+WG Fetch specification)\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Returns \href{http://npm.im/minipass}{\texttt{ minipass}} streams instead of node-\/core streams.
\item Supports the full set of \href{https://nodejs.org/api/https.html\#https_https_request_options_callback}{\texttt{ TLS Options that may be provided to {\ttfamily https.\+request()}}} when making {\ttfamily https} requests.
